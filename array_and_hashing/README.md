# Things learned

- searching in dictionary( hash table) is of time complexity of O(1) while searching in arr is O(n).

- 1 is not equal to '1' in python ans other languages as the ASCII value of '1' is 49.

- conditions with ASCII values in 3 ways:

```python
if 97 <= ord(s[i]) <= 122 and
ord('a') <= ord(s[i]) <= ord('z') and
'a' <= s[i] <= 'z':
```
